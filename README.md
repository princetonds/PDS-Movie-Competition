# PDS-Movie-Competition

Here's where you can access the training and test sets for the PDS Movie Competition. Good luck and have fun!

# Downloading the Data

You should download movies_data_test.csv and movies_data_public_train.csv. movies_data_public_train.csv is the training data (where we provide you the revenue values), and movies_data_test.csv is the testing data. To download the data, click on the file in the Github, and then click on "View raw". A new window will pop up with the data in your browser. You should then right click on the window and click on Save as to download the file to your computer. 

sample_submission.csv is an example of what your final submission to EvalAI should look like after predicting on movies_data_test.csv. We will be releasing a starter notebook soon with some basic code to help you get started with the competition.
